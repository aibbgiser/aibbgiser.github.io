    *16/11/18*
    Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.
    For example,
    Given [1,2,0] return 3,
    and [3,4,-1,1] return 2.
    Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.

    *16/10/08*
    #1. Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
    Note:Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
    
    #2. Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one. Find that single one.
    Note:Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
    
    #3. Given an array of numbers nums, in which exactly two elements appear only once and all the other elements appear exactly twice. Find the two elements that appear only once.
    For example:
    Given nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 5], return [3, 5].
    Note:The order of the result is not important. So in the above example, [5, 3] is also correct.
    Your algorithm should run in linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it using only constant space complexity?

    *16/09/11*
　　Given an array of size n, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than n/2 times.
    You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exist in the array.

## <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/alivirus/article/details/52504463">189 - rotate array</a>
    *16/09/11*
    Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
    For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
    Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?

## <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/alivirus/article/details/53219789">442. Find All Duplicates in an Array</a>
    *16/10/08*
    Given an array of integers, 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
    Find all the elements that appear twice in this array.
    Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime?
    Example:
    Input:
    [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
    Output:
    [2,3]
    
## <a href="http://blog.csdn.net/alivirus/article/details/53221391">448. Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array</a>
    *16/10/08*
    Given an array of integers where 1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n (n = size of array), some elements appear twice and others appear once.
    Find all the elements of [1, n] inclusive that do not appear in this array.
    Could you do it without extra space and in O(n) runtime? You may assume the returned list does not count as extra space.
    Example:
    Input:
    [4,3,2,7,8,2,3,1]
    Output:
    [5,6]
